Who am I?
If we forget for a moment the philosophical implications of this question, I am a PhD student at Carranza Lab, one of the research groups within the Animal Biodiversity and Evolution Program in the Insitute of Evolutionary Biology of Barcelona. Does that define me? For better or worse, I guess pretty much, at least these days. But I am also a music, book, film and nature lover. I think that is a fair summary of my interests. I am a part-time scientist (if that is ever possible), but a full-time learner.
